PHP-Bash-cli
============

A simple (bash based) PHP command line interface.

__This is how to use it__

Simply type, in the same directory of the file:

    ~$ bash php-cli.sh

And then you are in.
You have to know that...: 
  · For execute, just have to press ENTER twice
  · For list commands, just have to type "listar"
  · For deleting last line-command, just have to type "borrar"
  · For changing these commands, change the first lines of the script
  · Any command you type, it will be understood as PHP code line, and will be appended to the array.
  · The commands are not written to the file (which will be really created in the same directory with the default name "test.php", so must have the proper rights, and of course you can change the name in the first lines of the script) until it is demanded to be executed.
